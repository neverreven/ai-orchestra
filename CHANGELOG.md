# Changelog

All notable changes to the `ai-orchestra` core are recorded here.

The orchestra core follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Per-project installations record the version they were generated against in `.ai-orchestra/install.json`.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-alpha] — 2026-04-29

### Added — PR 1 (Foundation + Discovery)

- Top-level scaffold: `README.md`, `RUN.md` canonical entry point, `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `core/discovery/DETECTION.md` describing the probe process.
- `core/discovery/signals/` detector definitions for JS/TS, Python, Salesforce, Go, Rust, .NET, mobile, and MCP configurations.
- `core/discovery/existing-infra.md` describing how to detect prior agentic setup (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, VS Code) before any install.
- `core/registry/install.schema.md` defining the per-project `.ai-orchestra/install.json` marker.
- `adapters/_contract.md` defining the adapter interface — the binding between core content and IDE-native installation.

### Notes

- This is an alpha release. The orchestra core is structurally complete for PR 1, but role library, director system, adapters, and stack packs are intentionally not present yet — they arrive in subsequent PRs.
- v1 ships with no runtime code. All deliverables are markdown specifications consumed by an external agent at install time.
